Web-Based Embroidery Quoting Tool Design

Overview & Objectives

This project is a web-based embroidery quoting tool for in-house production teams. The goal is to quickly and accurately quote embroidery jobs with minimal manual input. It will combine automated .DST file parsing (for stitch counts and design details) with the cost calculation logic from the existing Excel sheet and Python script. The result is a fast, intuitive application that lets production staff get precise cost breakdowns and customer prices on the fly ￼. By automating stitch count extraction and material cost calculations, the tool ensures consistent, professional quotes every time ￼. Key objectives include:
	•	Speed & Accuracy: Instantly generate stitch counts and costs from the uploaded design, reducing human error.
	•	Minimal Input: Leverage DST data to pre-fill fields so users only tweak a few settings (hoop size, thread type, etc.).
	•	Dual Outputs: Provide an internal detailed breakdown (for cost analysis) and a customer-facing quote (clean summary with price).
	•	Polished UI/UX: Design a responsive, card-based interface that’s as refined as a modern iOS app, making the quoting process simple and pleasant.

Target users are internal staff (production, sales, customer service), so no login or roles are required – anyone on the team can use it. The app will be optimized for desktop browsers (common in production offices) but remain mobile-friendly for on-the-go access.

Core Functionalities

1. DST File Upload & Parsing

The first step is a .DST embroidery file upload. Users can drag-and-drop or select a DST file containing the embroidery design. Upon upload, the backend will parse the DST file using the logic from the provided Python script (which utilizes the pyembroidery library). This parsing will extract key design data automatically:
	•	Stitch Count: Total number of stitches in the design.
	•	Color Changes: Number of thread color changes (helps infer number of colors used).
	•	Trims/Jumps: Count of thread trims or jumps, if needed for advanced cost logic (optional).
	•	Design Dimensions: Width and height of the embroidery design (in mm and inches).
	•	Stitch Density & Complexity: The script computes stitch density (stitches per area) and even a complexity score based on stitch count, density, color count, and size ￼ ￼. This can be used to inform any difficulty-based markup or at least display a “complexity” indicator in the UI.
	•	Thread Length Estimate: An approximate top thread length needed (the Python logic uses a heuristic: ~1 meter per 500 stitches ￼). This is converted to yards for consistency with spool units ￼.

All these details will be captured instantly on file upload – no manual counting needed. For example, if a user uploads a design, the system might display: “Stitch Count: 10,500; Colors: 3; Size: 3.5in × 2in”. The tool could also generate a preview image of the embroidery (using the pattern data), giving a visual confirmation of the design. This preview can be rendered on a canvas or image element in the UI, as the Python script demonstrates with PIL (Pillow).

Error Handling: If the file is not a valid DST or parsing fails, the app will show a clear error message (e.g., “Unable to read embroidery file – please upload a valid .DST file”). This ensures user confidence that the data is correctly read or alerts them to try another file.

2. User Input Form (Job Info & Materials)

After parsing the DST, the app presents a user input form for any additional details and overrides. The form is organized into a clean, sectioned layout, where each section is presented as a card. Each card groups related fields, making the form easy to scan ￼ and reducing the intimidation of a long form. The sections/cards might include:
	•	Job Info: General details about the job. Fields:
	•	Job Name / Reference: (Optional) A text field to label the quote (e.g., “ACME Corp Hat Logo”).
	•	Quantity: Number of pieces to be embroidered. This is crucial for cost calculations (total thread, stabilizer, etc.).
	•	Garment Type: Dropdown (e.g., Hat, T-Shirt, Jacket). This helps provide context and could tie into materials (for instance, hats might default to using a cap backing).
	•	Fabric Type: Dropdown (e.g., Cotton, Polyester, Performance Knit, etc.). This can be used to suggest stabilizer type (cutaway for unstable fabrics vs. tearaway for stable fabrics) in the background. It also serves as a note for production but doesn’t heavily alter cost in the current scope.
	•	Hoop Size: Dropdown or input (e.g., 4” hoop, 12” hoop). Smart default: based on design dimensions, the system can pre-select the smallest hoop that fits the design. For example, if the design is 3.5″ wide, it might default to a 4″ hoop. This helps users but allows override if they plan to use a different hoop. (Hoop size may indirectly affect stabilizer usage; in our cost, we assume one piece of stabilizer per garment, but a very large hoop might use a larger stabilizer sheet – future iterations could refine this).
	•	Placement/Other Notes: (Optional) e.g., “Left Chest” or “Cap front”. This doesn’t affect cost but can be included in the quote output for clarity.
	•	Materials & Settings: Fields that influence production and cost calculations:
	•	Thread Type/Weight: Dropdown (40wt Poly, 60wt Poly, Metallic, etc.). Default: 40wt polyester (industry standard). If 60wt is chosen, the system can adjust the stitch speed assumption (since 60wt often requires slower speeds, as in the Python logic where 60wt had a lower default RPM ￼). If a special thread type is chosen (e.g., metallic), the app could later incorporate a higher thread cost or slower speed – for now, it can simply note it (or disable if not supported yet).
	•	Number of Colors: This can be auto-filled from the DST’s color changes count (e.g., DST with 2 color changes implies 3 colors used, since the code adds +1 ￼). The user can adjust if necessary (perhaps the design has color stops that reuse the same thread, or they plan to simplify colors in production). This field affects how many spools are needed (one spool per color per head typically).
	•	Use 3D Foam: Checkbox (default off). If checked, the cost calculation will include 3D foam material and the design preview might show a note “3D Puff Embroidery”. Enabling this might also suggest using a slightly larger design area to account for foam margin (like the code adds 0.5″ margin for foam pieces ￼). Smart default: off for most designs; users would check it only if they know the design uses 3D foam (this isn’t auto-detectable from DST).
	•	Stabilizer Type: Dropdown (Cutaway, Tearaway, Specialty). Default could be based on Fabric Type (e.g., choose cutaway for stretchy fabric, tearaway for stable fabric). While this might not change cost (if all stabilizer pieces cost similar), it provides context. In future, different stabilizer types or multiple layers could adjust the stabilizer cost per piece (e.g., 2 pieces of tearaway for caps). For now, the cost logic will assume one piece of backing per item, at a fixed cost (from the spreadsheet, roughly $0.18 each).
	•	Machine Heads (Production Capacity): If applicable, a slider or number input for how many machine heads will run this job simultaneously. Default: use the maximum available (e.g., 4-head or 6-head machine, depending on the shop’s equipment). In the Python logic this was active_heads (default 15 in the example code, but realistic values are maybe 1, 4, 6, etc.). This affects how many items are done per machine cycle and thus total production time. If the user’s shop only has single-head machines, they can set 1; if they have a multi-head, they set the number of heads used. A tooltip can explain: “Number of embroidery heads running concurrently. More heads = faster job completion (but same material cost).”
	•	Stitching Speed: This could be inferred from Thread Weight (e.g., 750 spm for 40wt, 600 spm for metallic, etc.) or offered as an advanced input. We might hide this by default and just use an assumption, since it doesn’t change cost, only time. For now, we use a default speed (from constants, e.g., 750 stitches/min for 40wt ￼).
	•	Pricing & Markup: This section will display results (after calculation) but may also include one or two inputs related to pricing strategy:
	•	Markup or Margin: An input to set the desired profit margin or markup percentage. For instance, user could enter “50%” margin or “100%” markup. (We can decide one approach to keep it simple – e.g., ask for a Markup % to add on top of cost). Default: could be pre-filled from the spreadsheet’s logic (if the Excel typically used, say, 10% on materials or a certain profit factor). For example, if the company standard is a 40% overhead/profit on production costs, we could default to 40%. A tooltip will clarify: e.g., “Percentage of cost to add as profit. E.g., 20% means price = cost * 1.2.”
	•	Setup Fee: Optional one-time charge. Many embroidery jobs have a setup or digitizing fee for small runs or new designs. By default this can be 0 (no extra fee), but the user can input an amount (e.g., $20) if they want to include it. A tooltip might say: “One-time setup fee (e.g., for new digitizing or small order handling). This will be added to the total price (not per item).”

Every field in the form will have a subtle “info” tooltip on hover (an ⓘ icon or question mark next to the label) providing guidance. For example, hovering “Hoop Size” might show: “Select a hoop that comfortably fits the design. This does not change cost, but ensures you plan appropriately.” Hovering “Thread Weight” could show: “40wt is standard thread thickness; 60wt is finer thread (slower to stitch, good for small text).” These high-context tooltips ensure even less experienced team members understand each input’s purpose.

The form will be designed with large, easy-to-read input fields and labels. Inputs will have clear labels, and sections will be visually separated, possibly with subtle backgrounds or borders on each card. This way, users can progress through the form step-by-step or quickly jump to a section of interest. The flow will feel natural and guided, potentially with a progress indicator at the top showing steps like “1. Upload Design → 2. Materials & Costs → 3. Quote Output”. This stepper gives users awareness of where they are and what’s next.

3. Cost & Margin Calculation Logic

Once the DST is parsed and the user inputs are provided (or as soon as defaults are confirmed), the application will calculate the costs and suggested price in real-time. The calculation engine combines the raw material cost estimation from the Python script with the markup and pricing formulas from the spreadsheet. Key calculations include:
	•	Thread Consumption & Cost: Using the estimated thread length from the DST data. For example, if the design needs ~20 yards of thread per piece (including a small buffer), and the thread is typically from 5500-yard spools costing about $9.69 each ￼, the system will determine how many spools are needed for the entire run. It assumes each color needs its own spool per machine head. If the design has 3 colors and you’re running on 2 heads, that’s 6 spools in use (even if each spool isn’t fully consumed). However, to avoid over-charging for thread, we could calculate thread actually used: total yards for job = 20 yards * quantity, then determine spools needed = total yards / 5500 (round up to whole spools). Then Thread Cost = spools * price per spool ￼. This ensures large orders account for multiple spools if needed, while small orders might only use a fraction of a spool (but we still likely charge at least one spool of each color).
	•	Bobbin Consumption & Cost: The bobbin thread (underside thread) consumption is estimated as a percentage of top thread. The Python logic uses ~40% of top thread length as bobbin length ￼. Each bobbin has a fixed yardage (the Excel noted ~148 yards per bobbin; code used 124 yards ￼ ￼ possibly for a different type). We’ll use the data from the spreadsheet, say 144 bobbins cost $44 (approx $0.30 each) which aligns to maybe ~130-150 yards each. The calculation: total bobbin yards for job = 0.4 * total top thread yards. Bobbins needed = total bobbin yards / yards-per-bobbin (ceiling). Then Bobbin Cost = (bobbins_needed) * cost_per_bobbin ￼. (In code they converted cost per 144, but we can simplify to per bobbin unit cost).
	•	Stabilizer/Backing Cost: Each embroidered item typically uses one piece of stabilizer backing. From the spreadsheet, backing costs about $0.18 per piece (e.g., $46.90 for 250 pieces including shipping). We will calculate Stabilizer Cost = quantity * cost_per_backing_piece. If garment type or design is unusually large requiring two pieces, the user could reflect that by doubling the quantity or selecting a different stabilizer type, but by default one per item. This cost is added to the material total. (If the design is 3D foam, the stabilizer usage is still one per item; foam is additional).
	•	3D Foam Cost (optional): If 3D foam is used, we need to account for foam sheets. Suppose foam sheets cost $2.45 each ￼ and are of a certain size (e.g., 18x12 inches). We calculate how many pieces can be cut from one sheet given the design dimensions plus a margin ￼. For example, a 18x12 sheet can yield several logo-sized foam pieces. The Python logic computed pieces_per_sheet = floor(sheet_width / (design_width+margin)) * floor(sheet_height / (design_height+margin)) ￼, then sheets_needed = ceil(quantity / pieces_per_sheet). Then Foam Cost = sheets_needed * price_per_sheet ￼. If foam is not used, this cost is $0.
	•	Machine Running Time: Even though we are not including labor or machine depreciation cost in the price (per instructions), we will compute the production time for information and scheduling. Using the stitch count and selected machine speed, we get stitch time per piece = stitch_count / stitches_per_minute ￼. If multiple heads are used, they sew in parallel, so per cycle the machine produces active_heads pieces in that time. We compute how many cycles needed = ceil(quantity / active_heads) ￼. We’ll also account for a standard hooping time per garment (say ~50 seconds each to hoop and unhoop as given in code constants) and a small buffer between cycles (e.g., 1 minute between runs for thread changes or adjustments ￼). Summing these gives total runtime for the job. This might be shown as “Estimated Production Time: X minutes” internally. We won’t convert that to a dollar cost, but it helps decide scheduling or rush fees if needed.
	•	Total Material Cost: Summation of all material costs: Thread + Bobbin + Backing + Foam (if any) + any other consumables. At this stage, we have a per-job cost for materials. We could also present a cost per piece by dividing by quantity (to see, for instance, “Material cost per item = $0.xx”). The tool might show something like a breakdown table:

Cost Component	Calculation Detail	Total Cost (USD)
Thread	6 spools (5500 yd ea) @ $9.69	$58.14
Bobbin	20 bobbins @ $0.30	$6.00
Stabilizer	100 pieces @ $0.18	$18.00
3D Foam	0 (not used)	$0.00
Total Materials		$82.14

(This is just an example for illustration; actual numbers depend on inputs.)

	•	Applying Markup/Margin: After material cost, the system will compute the suggested selling price. If the user provided a markup percentage, we apply it: for example, if total material cost is $82.14 and markup is 50%, the profit added is $41.07, giving a total price of ~$123.21 for the job. If a setup fee was specified (say $20), that is added on top. We can present both the total quote and a per-piece price. In this example, if quantity was 100 pieces, $123.21 total + $20 setup = $143.21, which is $1.432 per piece. We might round or adjust as needed (maybe the company rounds to the nearest cent or 5 cents).
To align with the spreadsheet’s logic, which had a notion of profit factor on different components, we will simplify: focus on a single markup on the overall cost (since labor/overhead are not separately calculated here). The user can adjust the markup to meet target margins. For instance, industry guides often suggest pricing per 1000 stitches (e.g. $0.50 per 1000 stitches) ￼, but our approach ensures cost coverage plus profit by computing actual material usage costs ￼ and adding a profit factor. This gives a more fine-tuned price than a flat per-stitch rate, while still correlating strongly with stitch count (since more stitches drive more thread, time, etc.) ￼.
	•	Validation against expectations: The app can cross-check that the final price per thousand stitches falls in a reasonable range (as a sanity check). If something is way off (e.g., user entered an unusually high markup or a quantity of 1 that leads to a very high per-piece cost), the tool could show a gentle warning or recommendation. For example, “Note: Price per stitch is on the higher side. Consider adjusting markup or confirming inputs.” This ensures the quote remains competitive and aligned with typical pricing models ￼, without enforcing a rigid formula.

All calculations will happen instantly when inputs are provided or changed. The app will likely implement this logic in the backend (for example, a Python/Flask or Node.js server) that receives the DST data and form inputs, then returns the computed results via an API call. This keeps the UI responsive – the heavy lifting (parsing, calculating) is done off the main thread. The result is updated cost information ready to display in the UI.

4. Dual Output Modes (Internal vs Customer-Facing)

One of the tool’s key features is providing two distinct outputs from the same data: an internal cost breakdown and a customer-facing quote summary. The UI will make it easy to switch between these or view both, and allow exporting either as a PDF. Here’s how each mode works:
	•	Internal Cost Breakdown: This view is meant for the production or sales team’s eyes only. It shows detailed cost calculations and metrics so the team understands how the price was derived. In the UI, after the user inputs and the calculations run, a “Pricing” card will display this breakdown. It includes:
	•	A summary of the design info (stitch count, size, colors) and job info (quantity, any special settings) for context.
	•	A table or list of raw costs for each component: thread, bobbins, stabilizer, foam, etc., as well as totals. Each line item might show the formula or quantity (as illustrated in the example table above).
	•	The chosen markup percentage and the resulting profit amount. For example, “Markup: 50% (adds $41.07 profit)” could be shown, or if the user input a target margin, show margin achieved.
	•	The final calculated price for the job and per unit. We might highlight the per-unit price, since that’s often quoted to customers (e.g., “$1.43 per hat”).
	•	Production time estimates: e.g., “Estimated run time: 2.5 hours for 100 pieces (with 2 heads)”. This helps internal planning but wouldn’t be shown to the customer.
	•	Possibly a simple pie chart illustrating the cost breakdown by category (thread vs backing vs other). This visual can quickly show if, say, thread is a minor cost and most of the cost is stabilizer, or vice versa. It provides a sanity check and is a nice visual touch for the team. For instance, if thread is 50% of material cost, backing 30%, bobbin 20%, the pie chart reflects that.
The internal view essentially equips the team member with all the information they need to justify the quote and answer any questions (e.g., “Why is this job more expensive than that one? – Because this design has 3x the stitches and uses 3D foam, increasing material usage.”). It fosters confidence that the quote is grounded in actual costs ￼. This view on the web page might be scrollable if very detailed, but organized with clear headings like “Cost Breakdown” and “Production Details” to segment the information.
	•	Customer-Facing Quote: The tool will also produce a clean summary quote intended for the customer or client. This strips away the internal cost details and focuses on the deliverables and price. It can be shown in a separate “Quote” card in the UI as a preview. Key elements of this quote output:
	•	Customer Summary of the Job: e.g., “Embroidered Logo on 100 Hats”. It would include the design size and stitch count in an informative way: “Approx. 10,500 stitches, 3 thread colors, size 3.5″ × 2″”. This educates the customer on what they are getting.
	•	Price: Clearly state the price being quoted. Likely as “$X per item” and “$Y total for N pieces” (including any one-time fees). This could be in larger or highlighted text. For example: “Price: $1.50 per hat (Total $150 for 100 hats)”. If a setup fee was added, we can either fold it into the total or list “Setup Fee: $20; Total including setup: $170”.
	•	Turnaround Time or Production Time: If desired, include an estimated production time or ship date (though that might be more dependent on scheduling). Since we know the runtime roughly, we could say “Estimated production time: ~2.5 hours (ready in 2-3 days)” or simply leave scheduling out if not within scope. Possibly just mention a standard turnaround like “Standard turnaround: 5 business days from approval” as a static note, unless we want to compute it.
	•	Design Preview or Thumbnail: Including a small image of the embroidery design can be a nice touch for the customer quote, confirming the design. We can use the generated preview image (maybe in grayscale or outline form) on the PDF or screen.
	•	Company Branding: The customer quote should look professional. It will use the company’s logo (if we integrate one) and consistent styling. The color scheme (blue, grey, etc.) can be used here to match the company’s brand aesthetic. The PDF output especially will have a clean letterhead-style or invoice-style layout.
	•	Optional Notes: Space for any additional notes to customer, e.g., “Thank you for your business. This quote is valid for 30 days.” We can allow the user to type a short note before exporting.

The PDF Export function will be provided for both modes. For internal records, a team member might export the detailed breakdown (or simply rely on the on-screen view). More commonly, they will export the customer-facing quote as a PDF to send to the client or to print. A “Download PDF” button will be available in the UI. When clicked, it will generate a PDF using the data: the Python prototype used ReportLab to do this ￼, but in a polished web app we might use a library or service to create a nicely formatted PDF (perhaps using HTML/CSS to PDF conversion for easier design). The PDF file name can incorporate the job name and date (e.g., Quote_ACME_Hats_Mar2025.pdf).

The customer-facing PDF will omit any mention of costs or markup – it will simply show the final pricing and job details, looking like a formal quote document. The internal PDF (if needed) would be more like a cost report for internal use and could be behind the scenes; however, since internal users can just see the breakdown on screen or copy it into other tools, we may prioritize the customer PDF export first.

A toggle or tabs in the UI can let the user switch between “Internal View” and “Customer View”. This makes it easy to review both. For example, the interface might have a tab interface or buttons: “💼 Cost Analysis” vs “📝 Customer Quote”. By default, after calculation, it might show the Cost Analysis, and the user can click Customer Quote to see the simplified version. This separation ensures no risk of showing internal info to a client by accident.

5. User Interface & Experience Design

Our quoting tool’s user interface will be crafted to be clean, modern, and intuitive, taking inspiration from high-quality apps. The design language will follow a card-based layout where each functional section is presented as a white “card” on a gentle grey background. This approach naturally groups information and creates a visual hierarchy that is easy to scan ￼. Below are the key UI/UX design considerations:
	•	Layout and Navigation: The app will likely use a single-page interface (SPA) or a multi-step form that behaves seamlessly. At the top, a header can show the app name (e.g., “Embroidery Quote Tool”) and perhaps the company logo. Beneath, the content can either be a one-page scrollable form or a step-by-step wizard:
	•	Option A: One-page layout with multiple cards stacked vertically: e.g., “Upload & Design Info” card, then “Job & Materials Inputs” card, then “Results & Quote” card(s). The user scrolls down as they complete each section. We can use techniques like expanding/collapsing sections or highlighting the next section to guide progression. A sticky sidebar could list the section names and highlight the current section in view for quick navigation.
	•	Option B: Step-by-step wizard: break the process into, say, three steps across different views or a carousel. For example, Step 1: Upload DST & confirm design info, Step 2: Enter job details, Step 3: View results and outputs. A progress bar or steps indicator at the top shows progress (e.g., “Step 2 of 3”). Users can go back and forth between steps. This approach ensures focus but might hide some info until you click next. Given the user base (production team likely doing repeated quotes), the one-page layout might be preferred for speed (no “next” clicks needed). We’ll ensure that whichever approach, the form progression is clear and users are never confused about what to do next.
	•	Visual Design (Style Guide Implementation): We will apply the provided style guide for a professional yet modern look:
	•	Color Palette: The primary color blue (#2D5BA5) will be used for headers, section highlights, and primary action buttons (like “Upload File” or “Download PDF”). This gives a trustworthy, corporate feel. The success green (#34A853) can be used to highlight positive outcomes or statuses – for example, a small badge “✓ Calculated” or the final “Profit Margin 50%” text could be in green to indicate a healthy margin. It could also style a “Success” alert if a quote is profitable or saved. The accent orange (#E67E22) provides contrast for secondary actions or highlights. We might use the orange for important values that need to stand out, like the final price or a “notice” icon, since it draws attention. However, it will be used sparingly so as not to overwhelm the primarily blue/grey scheme. The background will be a very light grey (#F5F7FA) which spans the whole app background, to give a subtle contrast against the white cards. The text color will primarily be a dark blue-grey (#2C3E50) for high readability on white, with lighter grey text for secondary information (e.g., tooltip text or labels). Overall, this palette ensures good contrast and an inviting, professional appearance.
	•	Typography: We’ll use a modern sans-serif font like Inter or Nunito (as suggested) throughout. Headers may be slightly heavier weight to stand out, while body text is regular weight. For example, section titles on cards could be in a slightly larger font size (e.g., 1.25rem) in the primary blue color, matching the polished look of an iOS app’s section headers. Input text and normal labels will be a comfortable 16px for readability. Consistent typography will make the app look cohesive and clean.
	•	Components & Controls: Buttons (like “Upload Design” or “Reset” or “Calculate”) will be styled with the primary blue background and white text (matching perhaps the style of iOS buttons but in our color scheme). They will have slightly rounded corners (5px radius for a modern touch) and change shade on hover for feedback. The cards themselves will have a subtle drop-shadow (e.g., box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)) and slight rounding (maybe 5px) ￼ to mimic physical cards and separate them from the grey background. This gives depth and an elegant look.
	•	Icons & Visual Aids: We will incorporate intuitive icons where appropriate, such as a small upload icon on the file upload button, an info icon for tooltips, perhaps a small chart icon near the cost breakdown chart, etc. These will be simple line icons or Material Icons for a clean look. They help users quickly identify actions (for instance, a floppy disk icon on a “Save Quote” if that existed, or a refresh icon on “Reset”). Any images (like the design preview or company logo) will be displayed crisply; we ensure the UI can handle high-DPI screens so that the app looks sharp on Retina displays.
	•	Interactivity & Feedback: As users interact, the tool will provide real-time feedback. For example:
	•	When a DST file is uploaded, a loading indicator or progress bar can be shown briefly if parsing takes more than a second (“Parsing embroidery file…”) and then replaced by the parsed results. In most cases, this will be very quick since DST files are small, but feedback ensures users know something is happening.
	•	After calculations, the results cards will update live. If the user changes a field (say, changes quantity or markup), the cost breakdown and price should update within a second. We may show a tiny spinner next to the “Price” field or simply update the numbers with an animation (e.g., fade in change or highlight change) to draw attention that values changed. This dynamic responsiveness makes the tool feel modern and powerful.
	•	Form validation: The app will prevent or warn on obviously incorrect inputs (e.g., if quantity is 0 or blank, we highlight the field in red and maybe default it to 1 with a message “Quantity must be at least 1”). If any required field is missing (though most have defaults), the user will be prompted. For example, if somehow no DST is uploaded, it will not proceed to calculation.
	•	Reset and Start Over: A clearly visible “Reset Job” button will allow the user to clear the form and start a new quote easily. This could appear in the header or at the bottom of the form. Clicking it will remove the uploaded file and reset all fields to defaults (with a confirmation prompt to avoid accidental resets). This is useful if the user finished one quote and wants to quickly do another.
	•	Responsiveness: The UI will be responsive to different screen sizes. On desktop, the ideal view might be a two-column layout in places (for instance, we could have form fields in two columns within a card to use space efficiently). On mobile, the layout will collapse to a single column stack for simplicity. All buttons and inputs will be large enough to tap on a touchscreen. While the primary target is desktop, the “mobile polish” means we ensure no elements are off-screen or unusable on a phone. The card-based layout naturally lends itself to stacking on smaller screens. Also, any tables (like cost breakdown) will be made scrollable or will collapse into a list view on very small screens to maintain readability.
Additionally, the design will adhere to accessibility best practices: sufficient color contrast for text, the ability to navigate via keyboard (tab through fields), and using semantic HTML or ARIA labels for screen readers.
	•	Example Workflow (UX): To illustrate the user experience:
	1.	User lands on the app and sees a clean page with a prompt to upload an embroidery file (Step 1).
	2.	They upload Logo.dst. Immediately, a card appears showing “Design: Logo.dst – 10,500 stitches, 3 colors, 3×2 inches” along with a preview image. The next section automatically expands.
	3.	In “Job Info & Materials” section, some fields are pre-filled: Quantity maybe defaults to 1 (user changes to 100), Hoop Size defaulted to 4″, Thread Weight 40wt, Colors 3 (from DST). The user selects Garment “Cap” and Fabric “Cotton twill”. They check the Use 3D Foam box because it’s a puff design. Tooltips are available if they hover any unfamiliar term (ensuring they feel guided, not lost).
	4.	They see a “Pricing” section update in real-time. The card shows: Thread cost $X, Backing $Y, Foam $Z, etc., total cost $N. Markup was set to 20% by default; they increase it to 30% and see the final price update from, say, $2.00 to $2.15 per piece. The cost breakdown pie chart updates subtly as well (though a markup doesn’t change the material breakdown, only profit). They are satisfied with a 30% margin which is highlighted in green to indicate a healthy profit.
	5.	They click the “Customer Quote” tab. The card now shows a formatted quote: “100 Hats with 3D Embroidered Logo – Price: $2.15 each ($215 total) + $50 setup = $265 total.” It looks client-ready, with the company logo and an image of the logo.
	6.	They hit “Download PDF”. A PDF is generated and saved to their computer, which they can send to the client.
	7.	They hit “Reset Job” to clear everything and move on to quoting the next inquiry.

This UX is smooth and requires minimal training. The polish and guidance in the UI instill confidence in users. As the Wilcom Estimator product notes, combining stitch algorithms with company pricing leads to quick, professional quotes with consistency ￼ – our tool achieves the same for the in-house team. Industry best practices (like basing pricing on stitch count and factoring in material costs ￼ ￼) are built into the tool, so even new staff can quote like an expert with the help of this interface.

Technical Implementation Notes

(Note: This section outlines how we might build the application to fulfill the design, ensuring the combination of Excel logic and Python logic is achieved.)
	•	Architecture: A web application built with a modern front-end (HTML5/JS) and a backend service for calculations. For example, a React or Vue front-end could handle the UI and form state, while a Python (Flask/FastAPI) or Node backend handles the DST parsing and cost calculations. The Python pyembroidery library can be used on the server to parse files as soon as they’re uploaded (the file can be sent via an API call). The cost calculation formulas from the Excel will be translated into code on the backend (or possibly precomputed tables if needed). This separation keeps the front-end snappy and the heavy logic secure and maintainable on the server. Alternatively, since the prototype was in Streamlit (all Python), the entire app could be done in a Python web framework, but to achieve the iOS-level polish and interactivity, a custom front-end is beneficial.
	•	Using Spreadsheet Logic: We will carefully extract the relevant formulas from emb calc.xlsx and implement them in code. For instance, the spreadsheet likely has formulas for markup (“Profit & Overhead Factor”) which we saw as 10% on materials in one part. We will confirm the desired default markup and ensure the code matches those results for test cases. The app could also allow exporting or printing the internal breakdown to compare with the Excel for verification initially. Over time, the Excel wouldn’t be needed; the logic lives in the app.
	•	Data Management: No database is strictly required (unless we add saving quote history). Each quote calculation can be ephemeral or saved client-side (e.g., in local storage or as a downloaded PDF). If needed, we could implement a simple history feature like the Streamlit prototype did (listing recent quotes with a timestamp), but it’s optional.
	•	Performance: DST files are usually small (<1MB) and parsing is quick. The calculation formulas are straightforward math, so even with complex designs, the results are near-instant. The web app will be optimized to load quickly and handle the computational tasks without noticeable lag. Caching could be used for repeated uploads of the same file (if a user re-quotes the same design with different quantities, we don’t need to re-parse the DST each time; we can store its stitch count and details in the session state).
	•	Testing & Validation: We’ll test the tool with known examples – perhaps cross-check a few quotes against the original Excel sheet to ensure the outputs match when using the same inputs. This guarantees our implementation of the cost model is correct. We also test the UI on different browsers and devices to ensure the responsive design holds up.
	•	Future Enhancements: Although not immediately in scope, the design keeps the door open for adding labor and overhead costs later. For example, if in the future we want to include an hourly rate for machine time or labor minutes per piece, we can add those fields and costs into the breakdown. The UI could then have an “Overhead” section or simply incorporate it into the cost calculation. Also, features like saving quotes, multi-line item quotes (multiple designs in one quote), or user account login could be added later, but the current design focuses on a single-design quick quote for simplicity.

Conclusion & Deliverables

In summary, the proposed embroidery quoting tool will significantly streamline the quoting workflow by automating design analysis and cost calculations, all wrapped in a user-friendly web interface. The combination of DST parsing and spreadsheet-based pricing ensures that quotes are both accurate and grounded in real costs, while the modern UI ensures the tool is quick and pleasant to use for the team. By following the outlined design, the production team can quote jobs with expert precision and confidence, improving efficiency and consistency in the process ￼.

Final Deliverables will include:
	•	A responsive web application prototype (accessible via web browser) implementing the described functionality. Users will be able to upload a DST file, input necessary info, and obtain both an internal cost breakdown and a customer-ready quote.
	•	UI/UX design assets such as clean wireframes or mockups of the key screens (upload screen, form fields, results view, etc.) reflecting the polished card-based design and style guide adherence. These serve as documentation for the intended look and feel, even if the prototype is already interactive.
	•	A working DST parsing and calculation engine embedded in the app, meaning the logic from the Excel and Python script are successfully integrated. The accuracy of calculations will be verified against known data.
	•	PDF export functionality for the customer-facing quote (and internal report if needed), allowing the team to easily download quotes. The PDFs will be formatted professionally with appropriate branding and information.

With these deliverables, the production team will have a powerful tool at their fingertips to handle embroidery pricing inquiries quickly and accurately, leveraging data-driven insights with minimal effort. The result is a faster quotation process, better transparency into costs, and the ability to present clients with professional quotes in record time, ultimately leading to improved trust and more efficient operations ￼.
